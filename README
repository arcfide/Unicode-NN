Major differences from nn-6.6.5:

The name length displayed is now based upon the width of the screen.

nn will now correctly parse From: lines that contain ()
        For example:
            From: "Jesse James (home)" <jjames@example.com>
        used to display as "home", the new behavior will display
        it as "Jesse James".  However, this may affect killfiles
        that depend upon the old behavior.
        To use the old behavior, set the new run-time variable
        'old-packname' to true.

Header check macro is now case insensitive for both news and folders.

Added GPG support, which comes with a new run-time variable 'sign-type', and
a compile-time variable SIGN_TYPE to set the default to either pgp or gpg.

nn will now look in /etc/resolv.conf for a domain if DOMAIN isn't defined
and hostname isn't a FQDN.

new command ":show config" will show the compile-time definitions.

nntp-user and nntp-password are now be settable in the init file.  Note
that this may have serious security ramifications if the nntp-password and
the users password are identical.

The current version of nn is available via anonymous ftp from
