The original idea of using MH (namely, comp) to send mail from nn
came from Jaap Vermeulen, but he wouldn't recognize what I did to
it.  I also used a suggestion from John Romine and Tom McCain.

Add

	set mail-script nn-use-mh

to your init file, where nn-use-mh is the following:

#!/bin/sh

# Obtain value of $WORK and $RECORD
. ${HOME}/.nn/.param

# Append Fcc: +folder to headers.  The folder is specified in
# mail-record.
if [ "$RECORD" != "" ]; then
	awk '
	{
		if ($0 == "" && !done) {
			print "Fcc: +'$RECORD'";
			done = 1;
		}
		print;
	}' $WORK > /tmp/aux.$$ && mv /tmp/aux.$$ $WORK
fi

# Compose and send the mail
comp -form $WORK

In addition, you can contact Ray Davis <rdavis@convex.com> for some
scripts that sort of turn nn into a MH front end by providing macros
to save, delete and refile articles in MH folders.
