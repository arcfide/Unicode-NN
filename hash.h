/*******************WARNING*********************

This is a *MODIFIED* version of Geoff Coller's proof-of-concept NOV
implementation.

It has been modified to support threading directly from a file handle
to a NNTP server without a temporary file.

This is not a complete distribution.  We have only distributed enough
to support NN's needs.

The original version came from world.std.com:/src/news/nov.dist.tar.Z
and was dated 11 Aug 1993.

In any case, bugs you find here are probably my fault, as I've trimmed
a fair bit of unused code.
