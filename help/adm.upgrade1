;:AUPGRADE NOTICE;:A

You are now using nn release 6.6.

The major change from release 6.3 is that the ~/.nn/rc file is no
longer used, since release 6.4 onwards uses the standard .newsrc file
to store information about which groups you subscribe to and which
articles you have read.

Since you have no .newsrc file already, your current rc file will now
be converted into a .newsrc automatically...
