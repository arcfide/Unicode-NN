;:AUPGRADE NOTICE;:A

You are now using nn release 6.6.

The major change from release 6.3 is that the ~/.nn/rc file is no
longer used, since release 6.4 onwards uses the standard .newsrc file
to store information about which groups you subscribe to and which
articles you have read.

To upgrade to release 6.6, your old rc file must be converted to the
standard .newsrc format.

You already have a .newsrc, but it is older than the rc file, so
you may just proceed and let nn upgrade the rc file to the new format.

The existing .newsrc will be saved in .newsrc.old, so you can still go
back and merge parts of it into the new .newsrc in case you have
special requirement.
