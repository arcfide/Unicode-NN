;:AUPGRADE NOTICE;:A

You are now using nn release 6.6.

The major change from release 6.3 is that the ~/.nn/rc file is no
longer used, since release 6.4 onwards uses the standard .newsrc file
to store information about which groups you subscribe to and which
articles you have read.

To upgrade to release 6.6, your old rc file must be converted to the
standard .newsrc format, and nn may do this for you if you proceed.

However, the current .newsrc file is newer than the .nn/rc file, so it
is likely that you have used another news reader since you last used
nn, and that you just want to proceed using the existing .newsrc file.
