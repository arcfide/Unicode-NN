.SH NAME
nngrab \- news retrieval by keyword (nn)
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBnngrab\fP [ \-\fBc\fP ] \fIkeyword\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I nngrab
invokes \fInn\fP
on all USENET articles whose subject (or keyword) field(s)
contain an instance of \fIkeyword\fP.  \fInngrab\fP is a fast
equivalent for:
.sp 0.5v
	nn -mxX -s/\fIkeyword\fP all
.LP
For example,
.sp 0.5v
	nngrab tesla
.sp 0.5v
will retrieve items concerning Nikola Tesla.
.LP
Keyword case is ignored unless \-\fBc\fP is specified, and the
\fIkeyword\fP can be a regular
expressions (escaped to avoid conflicts with the shell).  For example,
.sp 0.5v
	nngrab "n.*tesla"
.LP
The range of search includes all newsgroups on the system,
including ones which are unsubscribed.

.SH SEE ALSO
nn(1), nnspew(8), egrep(1)
.SH NOTES
\fInngrab\fP \fIcan be\fP much faster than the equivalent command
shown above, if the tertiary news subject
database generated by the \fInnspew\fP(8) daemon exists.  To enable
the faster operation, \fInnspew\fP must be executed regularly by cron.
.LP
\fInngrab\fP uses \fIegrep\fP(1) to scan the subject database, so
if you are not running \fIfast\fP egrep (GNU-style) this is all for
naught.
.LP
\fInngrab\fP will use a subject database generated by \fInnspew\fP
independent of its age.  Thus, if you stop running \fInnspew\fP,
remember to remove the subjects file as well.
.SH BUGS
Under version 6.4 onwards, search of the "Keywords:" field is not supported.
.br
Search on name is not possible either.
