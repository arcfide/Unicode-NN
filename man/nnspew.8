.SH NAME
nnspew \- subject database manager (nn)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B nnspew
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fInnspew\fP builds a sorted database of all available subjects in the
\fInn\fP article database for fast access via the \fInngrab\fP utility.
.LP
\fInnspew\fP should be activated regularly to rebuild the subject
database, e.g. by \fIcron\fP.  For example:
.sp 0.5v
   2 6,9,12,15,18,21 * * *  root /bin/nice /usr/lib/nn/nnspew
.LP
Cross posted articles are only represented in the database once, and
identical subjects in each group are merged into one to use a minimum
of disk space.  This saves about 50% of the disk space otherwise
required.
.SH FILES
.DT
.ta \w'$db/subjects'u+3m
.\"ta 0 16
$db/subjects	subject database
.DT
.SH SEE ALSO
nn(1), nngrab(1), egrep(1)
.SH NOTES
\fInngrap\fP will use the subject database generated by \fInnspew\fP
independent of its age.  Thus, if you stop running \fInnspew\fP,
remember to remove the subjects file as well.
.SH BUGS
\fInnmaster\fP should automatically append new articles to the subject
database to keep it up-to-date, and thus require less frequent
rebuilding using \fInnspew\fP.
